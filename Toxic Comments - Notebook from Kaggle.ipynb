Anyway, I'm not intending to write anything in the article(wow they would jump on me for vandalism), I'm merely requesting that it be more encyclopedic so one can use it for school as a reference. I have been to the selective breeding page but it's almost a stub. It points to 'animal breeding' which is a short messy article that gives you no info. There must be someone around with expertise in eugenics? 93.161.107.169                                                                                                                                                          \n9    alignment on this subject and which are contrary to those of DuLithgow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nName: comment_text, dtype: object"},"metadata":{}}]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train[:100]","execution_count":54,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","execution_count":54,"data":{"text/plain":"                  id  \\\n0   0000997932d777bf   \n1   000103f0d9cfb60f   \n2   000113f07ec002fd   \n3   0001b41b1c6bb37e   \n4   0001d958c54c6e35   \n..               ...   \n95  003b9f448ee4a29d   \n96  003bd094feef5263   \n97  003caacc6ce6c9e9   \n98  003d77a20601cec1   \n99  003dbd1b9b354c1f   \n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          comment_text  \\\n0   Explanation\\nWhy the edits made under my username Hardcore Metallica Fan were reverted?
